# It's your turn to try creating and using virtual environments

1. Create two environments:

    ```
    conda create --name numpy1-test python=3.12 numpy=1.26.4 jupyter
    ```

    ```
    conda create --name numpy2-test python=3.12 numpy=2.1.2 jupyter
    ```

2.  Download these two test codes to your computer, and run them both in both environments.  (One should only work in `numpy1-test`, and the other should only work in `numpy2-test`)
